            my academic journey (and the quest for caffeine) ðŸŽ“
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Iâ€™m currently navigating the academic jungle at{" "}
            <strong>York University</strong> in Toronto, where Iâ€™m pursuing a{" "}
            <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> with an
            expected graduation in 2026. They say university is all about
            finding yourself, but so far, all Iâ€™ve found is an overwhelming pile
            of programming assignments, an ever-growing list of debugging
            nightmares, and a deep appreciation for well-placed semicolons.
            Somewhere along the way, I picked up a caffeine addiction and a
            habit of questioning my life choices at 3 AM.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Somewhere along the way, Iâ€™ve pulled all-nighters that turned into
            sunrises, had debates that spiraled into existential crises, and
            made friendships that feel like home. Itâ€™s a strange, chaotic blur
            of learning, unlearning, and figuring things out as I go. But maybe
            thatâ€™s the point, because in the mess of it all, between the
            lectures and the laughter, the stress and the spontaneity, I think
            Iâ€™m starting to find something after all.

            I&#39;m also a proud member of the <strong>Robotics Club</strong>{" "}
            and <strong>CSHub</strong>, where I attempt to build things that

            of learning, collaborating, and pretending to understand everything
            that&#39;s going on. It&#39;s a solid balance of academic and
            personal growth... mostly personal growth, though.

          <p>
            Software doesnâ€™t exist in a vacuum, it changes how we live, work,
            and doomscroll at 2 AM. Thatâ€™s why I spend a lot of time thinking
            about the ethical and societal implications of tech.

            In winter 2024, I took an ethics course that really resonated with
            me. I&#39;ve always been intrigued by ethics, especially metaethics,
            and how AI and technology are reshaping those concepts. The course
            pushed me to dive deeper into questions about morality in the
            digital age, questioning how emerging technologies like AI challenge
            our understanding of right and wrong.
